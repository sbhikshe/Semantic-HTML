                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

    <aside>
        <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
        <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" alt="Lead Generation image" />

            Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.
